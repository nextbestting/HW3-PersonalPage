          <h3>Experience</h3>

          <p>
            I’ve built experience at the intersection of analytics, operations, and product thinking. As a Finance Intern at
            Thomas H. Lee Partners, I supported reporting across multiple active funds and helped ensure deliverables were
            accurate and on time. I also wrote a Python script to track 320+ deals and categorize them in a way that made
            reimbursement calculations more reliable and easier to manage. That work taught me how small tools can unlock
            big efficiency when they’re aimed at real workflow pain points.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also the CEO of TrustGod Apparel, where I merged my technical background with business execution to launch
            and run a mission-driven brand. I built and maintained the e-commerce platform (Shopify + web fundamentals),
            optimized for better user experience, and launched a charity program that allocates a portion of profits back
            to the community through social engagement. That’s where I learned the full loop: building, marketing, operating,
            and constantly iterating to improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, my style is “hands-on builder.” I like clear systems, measurable outcomes, and work that’s fast enough
            to ship—while still being clean enough that I’d be proud to show it to a recruiter or teammate.
